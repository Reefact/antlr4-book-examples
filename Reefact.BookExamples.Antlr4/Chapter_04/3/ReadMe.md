### 4.3. Building a Translator with a Listener

This example shows how the application code of a translator can be efficiently decoupled from the parsing code generated by ANTLR using a listener.

_Remarks:_

_C# lexer and parser classes are generated with the following command line:_

```bat
antlr4 Java.g4 -Dlanguage=CSharp
```

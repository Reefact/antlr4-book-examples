### 4.2. Building a Calculator Using a Visitor

This example shows how the application code of a calculator can be efficiently decoupled from the parsing code generated by ANTLR using a visitor.

_Remarks: C# lexer and parser classes are generated with the following command line:_

```bat
antlr4 -no-listener -visitor LabeledExpr.g4 -Dlanguage=CSharp
```

### 5.3. Recognizing Common Language Patterns with ANTLR Grammars

This example shows one of the presented patterns, the Nested Phrase pattern which represents recursive description.

_Remarks:_

_C# lexer and parser classes are generated with the following command line:_

```bat
antlr4 NestedPhrasePattern.g4 -Dlanguage=CSharp
```

Below, the parse trees generated by the examples:

| a[1] | (a[1]) |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| ![ParseTree1](.resources/ParseTree1.svg "ParseTree1") | ![ParseTree2](.resources/ParseTree1.svg "ParseTree2") |

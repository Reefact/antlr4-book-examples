### 6.5. Parsing R

This example shows how to build a grammar for the R language which is an expressive domain-specifc programming language for describing statistical problems.

_Remarks:_

_C# lexer and parser classes are generated with the following command line:_

```bat
antlr4 R.g4 -Dlanguage=CSharp
```

Below, the parse tree(s) generated by the example(s):

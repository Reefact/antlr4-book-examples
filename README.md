# The Definitive ANTLR4 Reference

This project aims at gathering all the examples of the book [The Definitive ANTLR4 Reference](https://amzn.eu/d/cqjZfEa) by Terence Parr adapted to the Microsoft .Net platform (C#).

I have tried to organize the ReadMe in such a way as to create an interactive table of contents that will follow you as you navigate through the chapters and sub-chapters of the book, discovering the different examples.

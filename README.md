# The Definitive ANTLR4 Reference

This project aims at gathering all the examples of the book [The Definitive ANTLR4 Reference](https://amzn.eu/d/cqjZfEa) by Terence Parr adapted to the Microsoft .Net platform (C#).

I have tried to organize the ReadMe in such a way as to create an interactive table of contents that will follow you as you navigate through the chapters and sub-chapters of the book, discovering the different examples.

_Remarks:_

_The graphs in Mermaid format generated in the examples can be displayed via the online tool https://mermaid.live/. Unless omitted, they are also available in SVG format in the resources of each chapter (*-tree.svg)._

_Some URLs in the book are no longer valid. You can find below a list of links that are up to date (last updated 12/12/2022)._
